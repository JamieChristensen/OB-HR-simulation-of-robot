# OB-HR-simulation-of-robot
Robot simulation for student tasks on the OB-HR course Spring semester 2020 - In response to COVID-19.

This project was created to give students on an introductory robotics and hardware course (OB-HR) at Southern University of Denmark a framework to simulate simple robot programming.
It was developed specifically to tackle the challenges of educating students in robotics, without them having physical access to the normally open labs at the university.
The project was used in conjunction with Tinkercad to give students an idea of both the programming and electronics aspects of hardware and robotics, centered around the use of Arduino.

The simulation includes:
- Motor / Wheel and H-Bridge behaviour
- Line sensors (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9453)
- Servo-motors
- Ultrasonic sensor (Emulating this with a few caveats: https://components101.com/ultrasonic-sensor-working-pinout-datasheet)
- Utility-functions and minimal framework with Arduino-like syntax to control these components.

Which the students used to create simulated autonomous robots in, on a track with lines on the ground to follow, and walls to avoid.
